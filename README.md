# Which-Key

Like [Emacs which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key) but for anything.

Which-Key is a customizable command launcher. It lets you define any command,
be it starting an application, running a script, or _anything_ else, and bind
it to a memorable sequence of keys. Just bind `which-key` to some keyboard
shortcut, and then trigger your commands.

**Note**: This is in early development, so the UI doesn't look amazing, and there will be bugs.
